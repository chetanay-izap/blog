In this blog i do not have any thing particular to talk about. So it is just an introduction
of my new blog built on Jekyll. Since it is Jekyll based, so i've used Travis-CI for building
and github for hosting this blog.

As described in [About Me](/about-me.html), I'm passionate about programming, cloud computing,
Entrepreneurship. So that's whyat i'll be writing about.

So just want to say "Hello" and Thank you to take time to read this blog.
