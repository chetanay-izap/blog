Symfony team has made so many important improvements.

I started development of “JOBEET” on my local server using day by day tutorial. Yet i completed my 5th day and 
new routing management just amazed me. I am in the favor of symfony + doctrine and symfony 1.2.1 is bundled with doctrine. 
Now i will use symfony 1.2.1 in my next projects. I will keep posting about my experience on symfony 1.2.1.

I would like to thank symfony team for such an excellent work.
