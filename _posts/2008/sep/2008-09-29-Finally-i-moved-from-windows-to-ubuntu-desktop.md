  This was pretty hard decision to make because now i've planned to remove my dule boot and migrate to ubuntu. So from now, i will
  try to achieve everyday tasks on linux.

This is a bit scary drive because now i have to find the solution for every single thing i like to do on windows. Either it is 
watching move, or editing image. I will have to do everything on linux.

This is really great experience to move to ubuntu desktop from windows. I successfully setup my developing environment too. 
Successfully imported all of my mails from “Microsoft Office Outlook” to “Thunderbird” , all of my contacts and what else 
required.  Now this is the complete box i got who understand my programming feelings. I am not saying windows is not good but 
linux, particularly ubuntu is better.  For my programming i have eclipse, “An excellent IDE” pluginned with aptana PHP and ruby 
on rails. Also got filezilla as a my ftp client. Great thanks to ubuntu community to give me such a joy of programming.
