Today Ubuntu 9.04 has been released and i am also going to give it a try. Just removed my OpenSUSE 11.1 and 
installed a fresh copy of ubuntu 9.04. This time it seems to me more sound with my hardware configurations. Earlier version of
ubuntu were crashing on my hardware especially Firefox. Yet i couldn’t find frequent crashes of FireFox and thus ubuntu.

This time, it seems to me more stable. Another thing i'm excited to see ext4 file system but i am not using ext4 on production yet.
 Actually waiting for ubuntu community to make more testes ;). My NVIDIA graphics are running smoothly. I am very happy to back 
 to my favorite OS. I hope this time, i would never need to look back to other linux operating system. Believe me, I really 
 don’t want to look back even:). Thanks to ubuntu team and ubuntu community for their valuable contribution.
