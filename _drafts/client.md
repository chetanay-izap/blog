Software outsourcing is a territory full of risks, disappointment,
fakes, fraud, and failures. Vast majority of projects simply fail. Almost
everyone who tried to outsource a software project has a story that
ends with "if I would only know" or "I picked the wrong team". Programmers
and their managers are terrible. It's all because of them! They fail,

all failures in outsourcing is mistakes made by those with the money
&mdash; the clients. They are guilty in failures, more than everybody else.
