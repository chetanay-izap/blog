**Principle #1**:
"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."

Staying focused on "satisfy the customer" Agile adepts totally forget about
the "through" part. They think that a happy customer is the true
objective, while that "continuous delivery" is something that obviously
helps, but is not really critical. It's quite the opposite. The customer
will be satisfied if the software is created and delivered right. If the
customer is not satisfied, we find another customer &mdash; that's the
true spirit a professional software team should have in mind. That's what
the Manifesto meant, I believe. We make sure that our process is
"early and continuous" and the customer will be satisfied. We focus on improving
our process, not on satisfying the customer. Satisfaction is the consequence, not
the primary objective.

**Principle #2**:
"Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."

Most Agile teams understand "welcome" word here as a permission to forget
about any requirements management at all. What is the easiest way to welcome
changes? It's easy, let's just get rid of any requirements documents at all.
In that case any changes will be welcome, since they won't affect anything.
There simply won't be anything to affect! But this is not what the Manifesto
meant. This principle means that our requirements management process is so
powerful that it can accept changes at any moment. It's rather difficult to
achieve, if requirements are properly documented.

**Principle #3**:
"Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

- deliver your own tasks daily or hourly, not just the entire software

**Principle #4**:
"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

- work daily doesn't meen lack of clearly defined responsibilities

**Principle #5**:
"Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done."

- trust doesn't mean lack of control

**Principle #6**:
"The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

- face-to-face doesn't mean in the same office
- and here agile manifesto is simply wrong

**Principle #7**:
"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

- this doesn't mean we should not measure anything else

**Principle #8**:
"Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."

- this doesn't mean we should just burn customer's money indefinitely

**Principle #9**:
"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."

- this has to be translated to specific rules and policies
- attention means punishment for violations
- exellence means strict rules
- qulice

**Principle #10**:
"Simplicity &mdash; the art of maximizing the amount of work not done &mdash; is essential."

- we don't really follow that rule in most cases
- simplicity doesn't mean stupidity

**Principle #11**:
"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

- self-organized doesn't mean un-organized
- project manager must be present
- holacracy
- architect
- personal and individual responsibilities

**Principle #12**:
"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."

- we don't understand our roles
