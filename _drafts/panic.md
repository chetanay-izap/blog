Ever heard about "panic driven development"? Google it. I don't know your
situation, but I'm getting this from every second client.
"We need this now, pick up the phone!" is a replacement of a business plan.
Sudden phone calls, emails to all available addresses
at the same time, "ASAP", "immediately", and "now" &mdash; are the
most popular management instruments. What do you do in such situations?
How do you manage that type of clients? I'm still trying to find the
right solution. The next few paragraphs are mostly addressed to my current
and future clients.

First of all, I totally understand why you are doing this. I understand
that you are in a very tough spot. You need something done.
