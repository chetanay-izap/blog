I have recovered from this situation. Here’s my scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-am-on-elasticsearch-version-1-1-0&quot;&gt;. I am on ElasticSearch Version 1.1.0&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-have-two-data-nodes-one-is-primary-and-other-is-replica&quot;&gt;. I have two data nodes. One is primary and other is replica.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-am-taking-regular-snapshots-of-my-indexes&quot;&gt;. I am taking regular snapshots of my indexes.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-am-no-more-taking-snapshots-so-i-have-installed-s3-gateway-plugin-to-keep-updating-s3-buckets-for-persistent-indexes&quot;&gt;. I am no more taking snapshots, So I have installed s3-gateway plugin to keep updating s3 buckets for persistent indexes.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of bulk import, i have stopped my replica to make import little faster. Once import get completed. I felt high CPU and Memory usage. And since i was aware that my indexes are safe because i am supporting s3-gateway. So i decided to restart remaining data node. Fuck…. It was a big mistake. When i tried to restart, it was not recovering all indexes. And we were about to launch our site in next two hours. And i am left with no index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Struggling here and there, i came to know that i am suffered with Bug in ElasticSearch. I tried to follow instruction at the end of this thread where i was suppose to update/edit metadata file from s3-bucket. I did that but no luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem i found, All indexes and shards suppose to have _source folders. And i had so many indexes and their shards where _source folder was missing. And those indexes were unrecoverable. I have no solutions at that place and was literately sweating in Air Conditioned Room. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one of my colleague, Narinder Kaur has joined me. And she gave me necessary support and we tried some more messes to fix it. Since i already made a mistake, So i took one backup of existing elasticsearch so that i would be able to back at same place in case of any other mess. And solutions we were planning to try was totally crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Solution we tried. and which actually works….. Wow!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-updated-my-elasticsearch-yml-and-remove-s3-gateway-settings-related-to-my-s3-bucket&quot;&gt;. I updated my elasticsearch.yml, and remove s3-gateway settings related to my s3 bucket.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-stopped-elasticsearch&quot;&gt;. I stopped elasticsearch.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-rename-my-old-cluster-elasticsearch-to-elasticsearch-original&quot;&gt;. I rename my old cluster (elasticsearch) to elasticsearch.original.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;restarted-elasticsearch-and-it-created-new-blank-cluster-where-i-have-no-indexes&quot;&gt;. Restarted Elasticsearch. And it created new blank cluster. where i have no indexes.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-created-all-required-indexes-with-the-same-number-of-shards-and-replicas-i-previously-had-in-my-case-i-had-5-indexes-and-5-shards-per-index&quot;&gt;. I created all required indexes with the same number of shards and replicas i previously had. In my case i had 5 indexes and 5 shards per index.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-i-stop-elasticsearch-again&quot;&gt;. Now i stop elasticsearch again.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;start-deleting-elasticsearch-nodes-0-indices-index-translog-and-move-elasticsearch-original-nodes-0-indices-index-translog-to-elasticsearch-nodes-0-indices-index-translog&quot;&gt;. Start deleting (elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/&lt;index_name&gt;/&lt;0,1,2,3,4&gt;/{index,translog}. And move (elasticsearch.original/nodes/0/indices/&lt;index_name&gt;/&lt;0,1,2,3,4&gt;/{index,translog}) to (elasticsearch/nodes/0/indices/&lt;index_name&gt;/&lt;0,1,2,3,4&gt;/{index,translog})&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Here, i did not touch _state folder of blank indexes. And now my all indexes has _status folder in each shard and each index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-copied-all-indexes-as-in-5th-step&quot;&gt;. I copied all indexes as in 5th step.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;restart-elasticsearch-and-i-found-all-indexes-were-recovered&quot;&gt;. Restart ElasticSearch. and i found all indexes were recovered.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observation: Well you should run your all custom mappings in blank indexes. I found some errors because i did not execute my mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank god, Now all indexes were recovered. And Thanks to Narinder Kaur, she got me required support at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blogging" /><category term="tarun jangra" /><category term="elastic search" /><category term="elastica" /><category term="S3-gateway" /><summary>Hufffff, Unfortunately i met this edge case.
