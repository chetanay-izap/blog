As an **investor** at [SeedRamp.com](http://www.seedramp.com) I have
no results yet :)

Once a month I send a summary email of my writing activity. If
you're interested to know what's going on here, I can add you to my
mailing list. Just give me your email address and briefly explain who are
you and why you're interested (I'm trying to avoid anonymous
subscribers in my list).

  <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="http://www.tarunjangra.com/subscribed.html"/>
  <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="subscribe me"/>
  <input type="hidden" name="_format" value="text"/>
  <label for="email">Your email</label>
  <input id="email" class="field field-text" name="email" size="25" maxlength="255" type="email" required="required"/>
  <label for="reason">Who are you? Why interested?</label>
  <textarea id="reason" cols="50" name="reason" class="field field-text" rows="4" required="required"></textarea>
  <label for="subscribe">&nbsp;</label>
  <button id="subscribe" class="field">Subscribe</button>

</fieldset></form>
